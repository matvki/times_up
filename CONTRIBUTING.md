# Contributing to IT Time's code

If you want to start contributing to the project's code, please follow these guidelines before creating a pull request:

* Bug fixes are always welcome. Start by reviewing the list of bugs.
* A good way to easily start contributing is to pick and work on a [good first issue](https://github.com/matvki/times_up/labels/good%20first%20issue). We try to make these issues as clear as possible and provide basic info on how the code should be changed, and if something is unclear feel free to ask for more information on the issue.
* Before adding a new feature, ask about it in [the Issues tab](https://github.com/matvki/times_up/issues) or check if existing discussions exist to make sure the new functionality is desired.
* During your Pull Request, it is imperative to do this on the 'dev' branch of the Git Repo !
